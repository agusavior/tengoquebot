# Tengoquebot
Telegram bot for manage reminders.

## Getting started
Let's suppose that your bot token is 725295115:AAHPBroPp21GIWE7NgLmriDfQ30hI3eAYHU

cd tengoquebot
printf '725295115:AAHPBroPp21GIWE7NgLmriDfQ30hI3eAYHU' > token

You can use virtualenv for install the packages, or you can use just pip.

# At the moment this was written, this commands install python 3.8.10
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3

# Install venv
sudo apt-get install python3-dev python3-venv

# Create the .venv directory.
# This assume that your python 3 binary is located in /usr/bin/python3
/usr/bin/python3 -m venv .venv/

# Activate the python venv environment
